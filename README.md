## Explenation
I use my calendar very much, and i would like to be able to use my calendar for alarms. This is a work in progress, end goal being an android app that will sync with my google calendar, fetching events and playing an alarm when the event has started. Then i can just use the calendar app and dont need a separate app for my alarms
